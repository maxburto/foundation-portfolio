intro: "<p>To coincide with a product tour road trip that the client was making across the United States we planned a campaign that included emails, posters, handheld signs, a microsite, and a photo submission contest. As lead web developer on the project I was tasked with developing both the back-end and front-end of the photo contest submission system as well as collaborate with the lead designer to program the microsite that the contest submission system was incorporated into.</p>"
sub_text: "A e-commerce site developed for Ghyslain. The goal of this new site was to improve customer interaction when browsing and perusing products. Backend usability was also improved over their old site, allowing the client to perform many of the periodic content updates to the site without help. Finally, customer security was vastly improved through the use of SSL authentication and the application of modern customer data storage best practices when developing the site."

    title: What I learned
    anchor: what-i-learned
    description: Building from experience gained while developing a similar user content submission contest for im|material I was able to add functional that was key to the customer involvement that our client wanted to foster with the campaign. Because of the product road tour incubating customer interaction from multiple locations was going to be an important aspect of the campaign. The location that the photo was taken needed to be included in the photo submission to the site. The photo submissions to the site had to be monitored, verified and judged all within the backend user portal by Newmar employees with limited assistance required from developers. After the photo submissions were verified by the backend Newmar employe the site then needed to display the photo submission on the front-end of the site including photo resizing, cropping and location mapping and the display of the submission as a pin on a map.
