intro: "<p>A e-commerce site developed for Ghyslain. The goal of this new site was to improve customer interaction when browsing and perusing products. Backend usability was also improved over their old site, allowing the client to perform many of the periodic content updates to the site without help. Finally, customer security was vastly improved through the use of SSL authentication and the application of modern customer data storage best practices when developing the site.</p>"

    title: Streamlining user interactions
    anchor: streamlining-user-interactions
    description: After a period of research we built the site on the powerful and flexible Drupal Commerce distribution of the Drupal content management system. This flexibly allowed us to structure and style the site to be completely responsive throughout all the user workflows, including the secure product checkout.

    title: Product flexibility
    anchor: product-flexibility
    description: To simplify the process of adding or editing products for users in the backend of the CMS each individual chocolate piece was built as a referable entity. The entity contained the individual image, name, and description of the chocolate piece and was referable to other entities on the site via the name of the chocolate piece. This separate entity setup was done so that when adding or editing products users would only need to search for and select the names of the chocolate pieces included in the product. This lowered product setup and edit time for the client and also avoided potential formatting and spelling issues that would crop up if a grid of included chocolate pieces had to be manually added or edited for each product.

    title: What I learned
    anchor: what-i-learned
    description: An important aspect of the site redesign was mobile device optimization. As the client, Ghyslain operates multiple physical store locations in Indiana and Kentucky, an important aspect of the site was the ability of the user to be able to lookup a Ghyslain bistro and view its menu while on the go from their mobile devise. Because the user may be in a moderate stress environment, looking up a location and viewing its menu, the site’s user experience was highly optimized for use on a mobile device. These optimizations include an off-canvas navigable main menu, button friendly button-like links. On mobile devices, some page sections displaying featured content were hidden to minimize visual clutter on smaller screens and also streamlined the user’s ability to perform certain tasks like finding the address, hours of operation, and menu of a Ghyslain bistro.
